1.)For both the single and multi threads I got 1636774716. That cannot be in seconds but 
it is what it is because I'm out of time. 

2.) It does not equal thread 1 + thread 2, but far less than that. I believe this is because
the super computer silo has many many cores that cen run so it just ran my process all together
giving me the same times.

3.) Multithread would be faster as multiple things would be calculated at the same time. This
is a nice theory of vector algebra where calculating many parts of one thing at the same time is
faster than calculation the big calculation linearly.

4.) My guess is that autograder is programmed to snoop for just the answer that would be expected 
and looks for it in the output.
